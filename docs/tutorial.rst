Tutorial
============

This tutorial explains in detail the different features of ``catwoman``.

Initialising the model
----------------------

As shown in the :ref:`quickstart`, to start setting up the model, one has to initialise a variety of parameters:
::

	import catwoman
	import numpy as np
	import matplotlib as plt
	
	params = catwoman.TransitParams() 	#object to store transit parameters
	params.t0 = 0.				#time of inferior conjuction (in days)
	params.per = 1.				#orbital period (in days)
	params.rp = 0.1				#top semi-circle radius (in units of stellar radii)
	params.rp2 = 0.1005			#bottom semi-circle radius (in units of stellar radii)
	params.a = 15.				#semi-major axis (in units of stellar radii)
	params.inc = 90.			#orbital inclination (in degrees)
	params.ecc = 0.				#eccentricity
	params.w = 90.				#longitude of periastron (in degrees)
	params.u = [0.1, 0.3]                   #limb darkening coefficients [u1, u2]
	params.limb_dark = "quadratic"		#limb darkening model
	params.phi = 0.				#angle of rotation of top semi-circle

	t = np.linspace(-0.04,0.04,1000)	#array of times to calculate the light curves for
	mod = catwoman.TransitModel(params, t, max_err = 0.1)	#initialises the model

As in ``batman``, the initialisation step automatically calculates the array of separation of centres between the star and the planet and also pre-runs the light_curve function numerous times in order to find the approriate integration step size for a given ``max_err``. 

``catwoman`` does this for all the supported limb darkenig laws ("quadratic", "logarithmic", "exponential", "nonlinear", "linear", "power2", "uniform" and "custom").

Note: The default for ``max_err`` is 1ppm and describes the allowed error (in ppm) between the smallest integration step size and the selected integration step size. The lower the specified ``max_err``, the smaller the step size and the longer this initialisation step will take to run.

Calculating light curves
-----------------------------  

To calculate a light curve we run the ``light_curve`` function like so:
::
	
	flux = mod.light_curve(params) 		#calculates light curve

This flux can now be plotted. 				  
Alternatively, if you wanted to change a parameter, you can do this by simply redefining the parameter of interest, say it is the ``params.rp``:
::

	params.rp = 0.09 			#top semi-circle radius (in units of stellar radii)

Now the new flux can be quickly calculated without having to re-initialise the model:
::

	flux2 = mod.light_curve(params) 	#calculates light curve

This can be repeated for any ``params`` change. However if you want to change the ``time`` or ``max_err``, the model will need to be reinitialised as a new integration step size will need to be calculated.

This can make it easy to loop over certain parameter inputs and plot many light curves quickly. For example, we can make the light curves for a range of ``phi`` values like so:
::

	params.rp = 0.1
	params.rp2 = 0.15
	
	phi_range = np.linspace(-90.,90.,7)
	for i in phi_range:
		params.phi = i			#updates angle of rotation
		flux = mod.light
