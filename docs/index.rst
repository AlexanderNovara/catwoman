Welcome to catwoman's documentation!
====================================

Catwoman is a batman extension to generate morning/evening terminator transit lightcurves. It is a Python package that allows the calculation of light curves for any radially symmetric stellar limb darkening law for planets modelled as two semi-circles, of different radii, using the integration algorithm developed for batman.

Please cite the paper Espinoza & Jones (in prep.) if you use catwoman in your research.   

If you find a bug or have any problems with catwoman, please `opening an issue <https://github.com/KathrynJones1/catwoman/issues>`_ on the project's GitHub and we will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
