Welcome to catwoman's documentation!
====================================

Catwoman is a batman extension to generate morning/evening terminator transit lightcurves. It is a Python package that allows the calculation of light curves for any radially symmetric stellar limb darkening law for planets modelled as two semi-circles, of different radii, using the integration algorithm developed for batman.

Please cite the paper <> if you use catwoman in your research.
